Prok V2 â€” Robust package

Files included:
- index.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/css/edits.css
- assets/js/firebase-config.js (edit with your exact Firebase web app config if needed)
- assets/js/main.js
- assets/js/admin.js
- assets/img/banner1.svg, banner2.svg, banner3.svg

Deployment steps are in the README inside the package. The code is defensive: if Firebase is missing it falls back to sample content and shows a toast.
